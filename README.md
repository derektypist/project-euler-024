# Project Euler 024 - Lexicographic Permutations

A permutation is an ordered arrangement of objects.  For example, 3124 is one possible permutation of the digits 1, 2, 3 and 4.  If all the permutations are listed numerically or alphabetically, we call it lexicographic order.  The lexicographic permutations of 0, 1 and 2 are:

    012 021 102 120 201 210

The aim is to find the nth lexicographic permutation of the digits 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 and 9 using HTML Forms and JavaScript.
